/**
 * Persistent storage for the server's request statistics (issue #255).
 *
 * The in-memory counters in ServerStats reset every time the server restarts,
 * which makes them useless for anything but "what has happened since the last
 * deploy". This class writes them to a SQLite database that outlives restarts
 * and upgrades.
 *
 * One row per (module, endpoint, operation) per collection interval, holding
 * both numbers:
 *
 *  - the *delta*: what happened in that interval. This is what you graph -
 *    plot count_delta against time and you have requests per interval without
 *    any differencing at the query end.
 *  - the *total*: the all-time cumulative count, carried across restarts by
 *    reloading it at startup. This is what you quote as "how much has this
 *    endpoint ever been asked to do", and it means a restart shows up as a
 *    flat spot in the graph rather than a cliff back to zero.
 *
 * Rows are only written for keys that saw traffic in the interval, so idle
 * endpoints cost nothing. Nothing is pruned: at 10 minute intervals a
 * continuously busy (endpoint, operation) pair produces ~52,000 rows a year,
 * which SQLite does not notice.
 *
 * better-sqlite3 (rather than sqlite3) on purpose: the writes are synchronous,
 * so the final flush in ServerStats.finishStats() lands on disk before
 * server.js calls process.exit(). A handful of inserts every ten minutes is
 * well under a millisecond, so this does not put the event loop at risk.
